## Analog
### What Is Analog?
- "Signal" is a varying wave over time, e.g. sound
- The wave travels through the air -- pushing on the eardrum-- at last recreating the signal
- This is an **anolog** process

### Frequency, Amplitude, Timbre
- Frequency (频率) - how often the wave repeats per second
	- "higher" note = more cycles per second
- Amplitude (振幅) - how high/low the wave goes
	- louder = bigger waves
- Timbre (音色) - the shape of the wave sounds different

### Sum Signal
- When multiple sounds are going into the air at once, the sound signals **add**, making a "sum" signal
- Ear and brain pull out and hear the component sounds

a high-C note:

low-C and high-C played at the same time

### Analog and Noise
- Errors in the sending process of signal -- noise, "hiss"
- e.g. AM radio, cassette tapes

## Digital
### Digital Technology -Digitization
The way an analog signal is brought into the computer is **digitization**.

- Horizontal line - zero
- sample the signal +- vs. the zero line

### Digital playback
Recreate signal from the numbers to waves.

- Number - height above/below zero line - connect the dots -- waves

### Why is digital data more resistant to noise?
Because even with noise added, it is relatively easy to distinguish the 0 representation from the 1 representation.

### Digital Compression
- Compression = change the data to use fewer bytes
- Lossless compression: 
	- Instead of recording all the complete numbers (12000, 12002, 12006, 12007, 12010, 12005, 12006 ...),  just record the first number and the differences to the next (12000, +2, +4, +1, +3, -5, +1)
- Lossy compression:
	- Drop every other number (12000, ~~12002~~, 12006, ~~12007~~, 12010, ~~12005~~, 12006 ...), saving 2x space
	- e.g. MP3, jpeg

## Digital Media
### Image Formats
- JPGE (Joint Photographic Expert Group)
	- Lossy format (adjustable detail preserved level, q1-q10)
	- Free and open standard
	- Mostly widely used

- PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and GIF
	- Lossless image formats
	- Used for non-photographic images

### Audio Formats
- MP3
	- lossy format
	- The dominant audio format
	- About 1 MB per minute and sounds good
	- Patent and legitimate

- AAC
	- Modern form of MP3 used by Apple
	- Has DRM (Digital Rights Management) features

- Ogg Vorbis
	- Free and open standard, royalty free
	- Performs better than MP3

### Video Formats
- MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group)
	- Standardizes some video formats in the industry
	- MPEG-LA (Licensing Authority) collects significant patent royalties
	- MPEG-2 - used in DVDs and some satellite TV systems
	- MPEG-4
		- h.264 - good looking video and minimum bytes
		- h.264 licensing - **restricted right to distribute your own video**

- WebM
	- Developed by Mozilla, Wikipedia, Google and others to support of a free and open internet
	- Free to encode or decode video
	- Free to distribute the video

- HTML5 Video Tag
	- Embed video inside an HTML page

- Flash
	- A product by Adobe
	- Patented
	- Supports animation and video
	- Uses h.264 for video compression
	- performs bad on Apple
