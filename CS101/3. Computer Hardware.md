## Computer Hardware
### Chips and Transistors
- Chip (芯片) - fingernail sized silicon
- Transistor (晶体管) - Chip can contain billions of transistors

### Moore's law
- Transistors get smaller about every 18-24 months
- Can fit twice as many per chip
- In effect, transistors/computers get cheaper (powerful)

### Bytes
- Unit of information storage
- 1 byte is enough to hold 1 letter, e.g. 'b' or 'X'
- Megabyte, MB, about 1 million bytes
- Gigabyte, GB, about 1 billion bytes

### What are the major parts that make up a computer?
**CPU**, **RAM**, and **Persistent Storage**.

**1. CPU**
- Central Processing Unit
- The brains
- Performs simple operations
- Code "runs" on the CPU

Each little gold pad is connected by a very fine wire to a spot on the silicon chip.

**2. RAM**
- RAM for "Random Access Memory"
- Temporary, working storage bytes
- RAM is "volatile (changeful)", not "persistent", gone when power goes out

**3. Persistent Storage: Hard Drive, Flash Drive**
- Persistent storage, preserved when not powered
- Hard drive (Hard disk) - stores bytes as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disk
- Flash drive (Flash memory) - stores bytes as electrons in a chip. 
- Flash storage forms: usb key, SD card in camera

Hard drive - connects to the motherboard with the visible standard SATA connector.

Flash drive - USB thumb drive

SD Card

### File System
- Organize the bytes of persistent storage
- "File" - a name, a handle to a block of bytes
	e.g. "flowers.jpg" refers to 48KB of image data bytes


### Microcontroller
- Complete computer on a chip
- Small CPU, RAM, storage
- Used in car, microwave, thermostat

## Bits and Bytes
### Bit
- The smallest unit of storage
- A bit stores just a 0 or 1

### Byte
- 1 byte = grouping of 8 bits (256 different patterns)
- 1 byte holds a number 0~255
- Red/Green/Blue value stored in **one byte**, so the value of RGB varies from 0 to 255.

### Kilobytes Megabytes Gigabytes
1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
1024 kilobytes = 1 megabyte (MB)
1024 megabytes = 1 gigabyte (GB)

e.g.
- A small email text - about 2 KB
- A 5 page paper - about 100 KB
- MP3 audio - about 1 MB per minute
- A high quality digital picture - about 2~5 MB
- An ordinary computer in 2012 - might have 4 GB in RAM
- A flash drive -  might hold 16 GB
- A hard drive - might hold 750 GB
