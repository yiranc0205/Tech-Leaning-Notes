## Digital images

### What is pixels?
Each pixels shows one colour. An image is made of many square "pixels".

### How to encode the address and colour of a pixel?
+ address - identified by x,y numbers
+ colour - RBG numbers.

RBG of some common colours

| Colour | Red number | Green number | Blue number |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| red | 255 | 0 | 0 |
| purple | 255 | 0 | 255 |
| dark yellow | 100 | 100 | 0 |
| white | 255 | 255 | 255 |
| black | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Image code
### How to set colour value of one pixel?
We need to know the *address* (x, y) and the *RBG numbers* of the colour.

 ```Javascript
pixel = image.getPixel(0, 0);
```
-- upper left pixel
```Javascript
pixel.setRed(255);
```
 -- set red value of that pixel

 ## Image For-Loop
### Why we need image "for loop"?
To let the computer to go through all the (x, y) values to look at each pixel once.

### What's the for-loop structure?
+ Syntax: `for (pixel: image) { ... }`
+ "body" code inside the `{ ... }`

```Javascript
image = new SimpleImage("flowers.jpg");

for (pixel: image) {
  pixel.setRed(0);
  pixel.setGreen(0);
  pixel.setBlue(0);
}

print(image);
```

## Image Expressions
### 5-10-20 Image Puzzles
-   Image where red, green, and blue divided by 5, 10, or 20
-   Scale them back up by * 5, * 10, * 20 to recover the original image
-   Puzzle: don't know which number goes with which color
-   Experiment to figure it out
-   There are only 6 possibilities:
-   5 10 20, 5 20 10, 10 5 20, 10 20 5, 20 5 10, 20 10 5

5-10-20 Banana Puzzle
-   Yellow banana, background of dark red bricks
-   Bits of dark green moss between the bricks
-   Use code pattern: `pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed() * 5);`
-   Scale up all three colors, using factors 5, 10, 20 to fix the image
```Java
image = new SimpleImage("51020-banana.png");
for (pixel: image) {
  // your code here
  pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed() * 20);
  pixel.setGreen(pixel.getGreen() * 5);
  pixel.setBlue(pixel.getBlue() * 10);
}

print(image);
```

## Image Puzzles
**Gold Puzzle**
Here we have the "gold" puzzle image -- fix it to see the real image
-   The green and blue values are all just random values in the range 0..255 ("snow")
-   The data of the real image is exclusively in the red values
-   In addition, the red values have all been divided by 10 (dark)
-   The green/blue snow is obscuring the real image
-   Write code to recover the real image
![alt gold puzzle image](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/65a287af7ee1025bd9735a0b77bc3c8b/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+CSX0001+1T2020+type@asset+block/puzzle-gold.png)

Solution code:
```Java
image = new SimpleImage("puzzle-gold.png");

for (pixel: image) {
// Strategy: zero out blue and green as they are just garbage data.
// Then scale red up by 10x to see the real image in red.  
// your code here
  pixel.setGreen(0);
  pixel.setBlue(0);
  pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed() * 10);
}

print(image);
```
Here's the result

## Grayscale Images
### How are gray colours yielded?
When all three red/green/blue numbers of a pixel are *equal*, the pixel is a shade of gray.
We'll say that these grays lack "hue".    

Examples of gray colors in RGB:  

| red | green | blue | colour |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 50 | 50 | 50 | dark gray |
| 120 | 120 | 120 | medium gray |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | pure black |
| 255 | 255 | 255 | pure white |

### How to convert colour to grayscale?
+ *In the for-loop*, define variable "avg" as the addiction of (red+green+blue values of each pixel) / 3
+ Set red/green/blue values to be the value of variable "avg"
```Java
image = new SimpleImage("flowers.jpg");
for (pixel: image) {
  // your code here
  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;
  pixel.setRed(avg);
  pixel.setGreen(avg);
  pixel.setBlue(avg);
}
print(image);
```

## Image Logic
### What is if-statement?
+ a kind of logic test true/false
+ to control if a bit of code runs or not
+ Combined with the loop, the if-statement will greatly expand what we can do with code.

### If-statement syntax
Here is an example if-statement shown inside a for-loop:
```Java
for (pixel: image) {
  if (pixel.getRed() > 160) {
    pixel.setRed(0);
    pixel.setGreen(0);
    pixel.setBlue(0);
  }
}
```


### Color Bars With Average
Recall this code which, inside a loop, computes the average of the red, blue, and green values and stores that number in a variable "avg".
`avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;`

Here are the three pixels again, but now the **avg** value is show as a line drawn across the bars.
![[Pasted image 20220120173536.png]]

A pixel is reddish if the red value is over the avg.  So here the first pixel is reddish and the other two are not. The test code will look like:
`(pixel.getRed() > avg)`

### Average * Factor Technique
Test: `(pixel.getRed() > avg * 1.1)`
`* 1.1` adjustment factor, tighten/loosen to get look we want
	e.g. * 1.7 makes test more restrictive
	e.g. * 0.9 makes test less restrictive

### Color Avg Test Example - Curb
Challenge: write code to detect the red curb, 
(a) change it to medium gray red=120 green=120 blue=120. 
(b) change just the red curb to be **grayscale**, which will look more realistic.

(a) solution code
```Java
image = new SimpleImage("curb.jpg");
for (pixel: image) {
  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;

  if (pixel.getRed() > avg * 1.2) {
    pixel.setRed(120);
    pixel.setGreen(120);
    pixel.setBlue(120);
  }
}
print(image);
```
result
![[Pasted image 20220120180404.png]]

(b)solution code
```Java
// This solution looks the best to me for (b).
image = new SimpleImage("curb.jpg");
for (pixel: image) {
  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;

  if (pixel.getRed() > avg * 1.1) {
    pixel.setRed(avg);
    pixel.setGreen(avg);
    pixel.setBlue(avg);
  }
}
print(image);
```
result
![[Pasted image 20220120175802.png]]

So, (b) Rather than (120, 120, 120), has the better way to change the red pixels to grayscale, which 
looks much better, as it reflects the dark/light of the real curb.

### Conclusion
-  `(pixel.getRed() > avg * 1.5)` pattern to detect pixel by color
-  The then-code can do anything we wish to the pixel

## Image Bluescreen
### What is image bluescreen?
-   Have some background image, e.g. leaves.jpg
-   Detect colored area in an image, e.g. red in stop.jpg
-   For colored area, substitute in pixels from background image

### Bluescreen Algorithm
![[Pasted image 20220120190847.png]]
Bluescreen algorithm:
-   Two images: **image** and **back**
-   Detect, say, red pixels in image
-   For each red pixel:
	-   --Consider the pixel at the same x,y in back image
	-   --Copy over the pixel from back to image
	-   --What defines how a pixel looks? Three numbers.
	-   --Copy over the red, green, and blue values
-   Result: red areas, substitute in areas from back image
-   Adjacent pixels maintained

```Java
image = new SimpleImage("stop.jpg");
back = new SimpleImage("leaves.jpg");

for (pixel: image) {
  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;
  // key code here
  if (pixel.getRed() > avg * 1.5) {
    x = pixel.getX();
    y = pixel.getY();
    pixel2 = back.getPixel(x, y);
    pixel.setRed(pixel2.getRed());
    pixel.setGreen(pixel2.getGreen());
    pixel.setBlue(pixel2.getBlue());
  }
}
print(image);
```
