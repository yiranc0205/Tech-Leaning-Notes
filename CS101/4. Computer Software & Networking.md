## Software
### What is software?
Software is **code** that runs on the hardware.

### What is program? 
- Program is millions of simple machine code instructions (指令). 
e.g. Firefox
- CPU runs a "fetch/execute cycle". It fetches one instruction in sequence.

### What Does "Double Click a Program" Mean?
- The instruction bytes are copied up into RAM
-  The CPU is directed to start running at the first instruction

### What is Operating System?
- Set of supervisory programs, run when computer first starts
- Administration behind the scenes
- Starting/managing/ending other programs

### Boot & Reboot
- Boot up -- start
- Reboot -- shutdown/start-fresh cycle
- When first powered on, computer runs a tiny "powered on" program to looks for a disk containing an operating system to run.

## Computer Languages
### Machine Code VS. Computer language 
- machine code
	- simple machine code instructions in the CPU
	- extremely rare to write machine code by hand

- computer language (e.g. Javascript)
	- used by programmer
	-  "high level" features (e.g. loops, if-statements, strings)

### Compiler
Compiler **translates** the source code into a large number of machine code instructions.

### Open Source Software
- Does not cost anything
- **Freedom** the end user -- make the change themselves

### Compiled language VS. Dynamic/interpreter languages
Compiled code 
- run faster
- the compiler translates source code to equivalent machine code
- like "consecutive interpretation"

Dynamic/interpreter languages
- have a greater number of programmer-friendly features
- tends to run slower than compiled code
- the interpreter does the code, looking at each line and doing it
- like "simultaneous interpreting"

## Computer Networking
### LAN - Local Area Network
- Ethernet LAN
	- **wired LAN**, 100 metres max wire length, RJ-45 plug
	- send - send the bits (0's and 1's) on the wire in the form of eletrical wave
	- receive - observe voltage pattern on the wire and then reconstruct the 0'1 and 1's

### Packet
- Before sending information, divide bytes into many packets.
![[Pasted image 20220126210541.png]]
 - Receiver can detect that the packet was received correctly through **checksum**
	 e.g. Sender adds up all packet's bytes in the sum of 157231, For illustration, and the last 2 digits, 31, is the "checksum" of the packet

### Multiple Computers -- Ethernet Design
- Layout: **one wire**, shared by all the computers
- **No central control** -- distributed, collaborative
- Send
	- Packet includes to: addr of recipient
	- Sender waits for period of silence on the wire, sends packet
- Receive
	- All computers listen to the wire all the time  
	- Pick out packets addressed to them, ignore other packets
	![[Pasted image 20220126211800.png]]
- Ethernet Collision
	- Two computers transmit at the same time
	- Both senders wait a **random** amount of time, then try again

### Wi-Fi
- Wireless networking
- Similar strategy to Ethernet

## The Internet - TCP/IP
### Internet?
Internet -- World-wide network 

### TCP/IP
- TCP/IP Standards, 1974, government sponsored research
- Every computer on the internet has an **IP address** (e.g. 171.64.64.166)
	- **4 bytes**, each byte varies from 0 to 255
	- Left part encodes "neighborhood" on internet
	- alternate names for IP addrs -- Domain names


### Router
- The router is "upstream" of the computer, connecting the computer to the whole internet
![[Pasted image 20220127002847.png]]

### How Does a Packet Get Across The Internet?
- Hops from the router to the bigger router, until packet gets to the destination
- Packet proceeds one hop at a time
- 20-30 hops typically
![[Pasted image 20220127004335.png]]
- Each router figures the next hop, not the whole route
- Routers are another distributed, collaborative system

### special "local" IP addresses
10.x.x.x and 192.168.x.x

### Ping & Traceroute
- Ping
	- Sends a "are you there" packet to a computer, getting back a "yes" packet
	- To check if the other computer is functioning and if the network path between you and it works
![[Pasted image 20220127005746.png]]
- Traceroute ("tracert" on Windows)
	- to see series of hops
