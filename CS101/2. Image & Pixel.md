## Introduction

### What is the fundamental equation of computers?
**Computer = Powerful + Stupid**
+ Powerful
	+ look through masses of a data
	+ Billions of "operations" per second
+ Stupid
	+ Operations are simple and mechanical
	+ Nothing like "insight" or "understanding"

### How does a computer work?
Computer is driven by "code" instructions. Programmers make it happen.

## Code writing

### What is *code* and *syntax*?
*Code* refers to the language the computer can understand.
Code is not free form. It follows a very limited and strict rule, which is *syntax*.

Code experiment with Javascript
+ // This is a **comment**.
+ "This is a **string**."
```Javascript
// The line below prints one number and one string
print(6, "hi");
```

### How to deal with simple syntax errors?
We can see the computer error report and fix them.

## code variables

### What is a variable?
 A *variable* is like a box that holds a value.
 
`x = 7;`
*X* is the variable. *7* is the value. *=* here is called "variable assignment (变量赋值)".   

### How to use variables?
A Variable can be the shorthand for the same value (numbers, strings, etc.) that shows many times in code.

Alice Alice Alice
I had a crush on Alice
```Javascript
X = "Alice"
print(x, x, x);
print("I had a crush on", x)
```
